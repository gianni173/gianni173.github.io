## __About me__
Hi I'm Gianni Vallerini, I live in Italy, Florence.

Currently I am a student at [__The Sign Accademy__](https://thesign.academy/) following the last year (3rd) of the Game Programming course.
My favourite fields are __AI, Machine Learning and Code Architecture__.
Videogames have always been a __passion__ for me, that's why, after my studies as Barman i decided to start this journey into Game Development.

I think that the most important part in a project is the team!
